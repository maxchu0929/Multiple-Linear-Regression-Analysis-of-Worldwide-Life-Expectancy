# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of Worldwide Life Expectancy

This project was for my STATS 101A - Data Analysis and Regression course. I searched for and chose a data set that I was particularly interested in. Discovering insight about the relationship between certain variables and human life expectancy could improve it and be a general way of bettering people's lives.

I employed course content about simple and multiple linear regression to the data set and built a regression model that can predict life expectancy based on variables such as country, GDP, and population. This was only a starter project to help me understand applications of linear regression, especially MLR. I plan to apply my knowledge of statistics and more advanced regression techniques to future passion projects.
